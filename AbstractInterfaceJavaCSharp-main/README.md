## A simple repository with code using Singleton Pattern in Java and C# 

### This project explore some key concept of Oriented Object Programming like:
  - Classes.
  - Object.
  - Abstraction: Show the benefic of these kind of classes instead of normal classes.
  - Inheritance: Show the proper way to handle thath and avoiding complexity (Even inside the class and when managing the Database).
  - Encapsulation: The powerfull of Abstract Classes and Interfaces.
  - Abstract Class: With sample Code in Java and C#..
  - Interface: With sample Code in Java and C#.

### Task to be performed before executing the code:

###$ Java Programming Language
  - The used IDE is *Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers. Version: 2019-09 R (4.13.0)*, but the same project could also wok with *NetBeans* or other IDE.
  - The two drivers jar files (*For MySQL* and for SQLServer-
  - Then Test each code's pachage separetely.

#### C# Programming language
  - The used IDE is *Visual Studio 2015* with the target .Net 4.0 for each project.
  - The proper **dll file** that support MySQL Database should be downloaded and linked as reference for corresponding Console Project or Class Library Project.
  - The Main project **SingletonLibrary** should be allow other projects to run properly.
  - Each project should be tested with corresponding Console Project to see the respective output result.
  - The default statup project should be changed to test each scenario.
  - The Database Script for both *SQL Server* and *MySQL* is available inside the database folder (Inside Java root folder).
  
#### The output

  > the Output should look like this screenshot (For Java or C#):
	
1. Database Connection.
